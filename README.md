# NodeJS Chat App

This project is part of my self-learning and developed using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

User can join the chat room by entering their name and room and talk to each other.

The app is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed via https://aqarain-nodejs-chat-app.herokuapp.com/

The tutorial followed for this is: The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) by Andrew Mead, Rob Percival (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2)
